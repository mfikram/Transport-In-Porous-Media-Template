\section{
Granular porous media are categorized as complex multiphase material, and due to this 'multiphase nature', their effective transport properties are of great importance in many problems in engineering and natural sciences. For instance, if we change the volume fraction of any one of the phases in the material the effective thermal conductivity, $K_{eff}$ also changes. Similarly, for a porous media when we change the porosity (volume fraction of the pore space), in a porous media, $K_{eff}$ also changes. A common observation is when the pore space is saturated with one fluid (single-phase porous media) and the thermal conductivity of the fluid $K_f$ is less than thermal conductivity of the solid phase $K_s$ ($K_f>K_f$), $K_{eff}$ decreases with decreasing porosity. The effective thermal conductivity of single phase porous media has been the subject of many studies and theoretical, experimental and numerical model have been devised for accurate prediction.  A thorough review of these models is present in \cite

If we introduce a second fluid in the same pore space, the granular porous medium becomes partially saturated and the behaviour
