<div>Transport properties of partially-saturated rock, soil, and other types of porous media can be significantly different compared to a fully-saturated media. The effective thermal conductivity of porous media depends strongly on the fluid distribution in the pore space, as well as on morphological changes such as compaction and directional consolidation. Grain topology and surface deformation of grains due to the overburden pressure can also affect the thermal conductivity. In a previous study, we studied these parameters in a medium fully saturated with one fluid in pore space. Here, we report on the results of the extensive two-dimensional computer simulations of heat conduction of granular porous media in which water partially saturates the pore space. Similar to the previous study, the grains have a rough, self-affine fractal surface, and the media are subjected to an external compressive pressure. The Young's modulus of the grains and the fractal dimension of their surface profile dictate the contact area for the deformation. The partial saturation of the phases is generated by a multiphase lattice Boltzmann (LB) method, while heat conduction is simulated by a thermal LB. Based on previous studies, the two linear intervals that emerge in trends of effective thermal conductivity versus the water saturation are less distinct when the effects of directional consolidation and elliptical grain shape are considered. A closer investigation reveals that thermal anisotropy in both of these cases offsets the effect of percolation of the wetting phase. Previous studies indicated the critical threshold for percolation was more prominent at low compressing pressure compared to high compressing pressures. However thermal anisotropy causes the percolation threshold to be less distinct even at low pressures, thereby exhibiting a pseudo-linear behaviour at all compressing pressures. Furthermore, the nature of the thermal anisotropy also changes when the partial saturation of the wetting phase is increased with the increase in compressing pressure</div>
